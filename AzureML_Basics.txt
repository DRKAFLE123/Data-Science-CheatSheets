        specify a tone - excited, cheerful using DNN
        insert pauses or silence
        specify phonemes - read "SQL" as "sequel"
        adjust prosody - speaking rate, pitch, timbre
        use common 'say-as' rules 
        use recordings or audio files 
    Language Understanding

        Publish settings    
            sentiment analysis - score of 0-1
            spelling correction
            speech priming - use language model. sends the model to speech service ahead of prediction to improve intent recognition
    Language Understanding from Speech

        Audio Config
        Speech + Audio - Intent Recognizer 
        Intent Recognier Object - Recognize Once Async
        Response

    Bot Framework
        Language generation
        visual design surface in Compose
        reusable assets in the form of JSON and MD files 
        Dialog
            bot will likely make use multiple dialogs to implement multi-turn conversations
            gathers information from the user, storing state between turns
            main dialog - begin conversations with user
            child dialog - subsequent message
            adaptive dialog - interruptive, cancellation and context switches at any time 
                one or more actions 
                Language Generator 
                recognizer to determine intent 
                Triggers, which are fired by actions or based on the intent detected by the recognizer
                memory - values stored as properties. user scope - for entire session of interaction and dialog scope 
            maintain state or restart 
            text, speech, rich user controls, cards
    Question Answering
        knowledge base of question and answer pairs 
        published to a REST endpoint and consumed by a bot 
        websites, files with structured text, existing chats 
        different from language understanding - static answers, utterances are questions only, easier to interprete with less errors
        Active learning and defining synonyms 
            implicit feedback - incoming questions are processed, similarity scores matched and clustered as alternate matches 
            explicit feedback - possible number of matches by specifying top parameter 
    Azure Bot Service 
    Bot Framework SDK 
    Bot Framework Service 
        Empty bot, echo bot, core bot
        Adapter class - handles communication with user's channel 
        conversations are activities (Process activity) which include turns (Turn Handler) 
        Activity Handler - event methods to override different kinds of activities
        Dialogs - more complex patterns to handle stateful multi-turn conversations
