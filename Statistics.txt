
population:
    entire dataset 
sample:
    simple random sampling: every occurence has equal chances of occurence
    stratified sampling: population split into non-overlapping groups or strata
    systematic sampling: pick every nth individual 
    convenience sampling: domain experts
    **depends on use case
Measure of Central Tendency:
    mean:
        average. outliers can adversely affect mean. continuous data imputation
    median:
        middle element. works well with outliers 
    mode:
        highest occurence. works well with categorical data 
Measure of Dispersion:
    dispersion means spread
    standard deviation:
        unit to measure how many SD away from the mean a value lies
    variance:
        talks about spread of the data
        higher variance, values are spread wide across the range 
    range:
        max - min 
Finding Outliers:
    percentile:
        percentage of values below the number in total sample
        what is the value at a certain percentile? index of percentile/100 * n+1
        q1 = 25% * n+1
        q3 = 75% * n+1
    quartile:
        lower fence = q1 -1.5(iqr)
        upper fence = q3 + 1.5(iqr)
        **any value in the dataset below lower fence or above upper fence are outliers
    inter quartile range:
        q3 - q1
Types of Distribution:
    Probability Density Function
    Cumulative Distributive Function
    ** integrating PDF we get CDF and differentiating CDF we get PDF 
    Gaussian Kernel Density Estimation
    Gaussian Bell Curve/Normal Distribution Curve:
        symmetrical data distribution on either side of median
        always follows empirical formula
    Empirical Formula:
        68-95-99.7 Rule
        first std deviation (68% of data points are present)
        second std deviation (95% of data points are present)
    z-score:
        how much std deviation is a value away from the mean 
        value - mean / std deviation
        after applying z-score to normal distribution curve, 
        we get standard normal distribution, where mean = 0 and std deviation = 1
        Standardization:
            mean = 0, std deviation = 1
        Normalization:
            define lower bound and upper bound using MinMax Scaler in Machine Learning
        Body and Tail:
            left to the curve normal is body and to the right is tail 
            refer z-table to calculate area under curve 
Probability:
    Addition Rule for:
        Mutually Exclusive:
            P(H or T) = P(H) + P(T)
        Non Mutual Exclusive:
            P(Q and Heart) = 1/52
            P(Q or Heart) = P(Q) + P(Heart) - P(Q and Heart)
    Multiplication Rule for:
        Independent Events:
            P(4 and 6) = P(4) * P(6)
        Dependent Events:
            P(Q and then an A) = P(Q) * P(B/A) (Conditional Probability)
            useful in Bayes' Theorem 
            P(Q and then an A) = 4/52 * 4/51
Hypothesis Testing:
    Statistical method to make decisions about the population with the help of only sample data 
    One-tailed and two-tailed test 
    Significance Value:
        alpha = 0.05, defined by domain expert 
    Confidence Interval:
        1 - significance value 
        if experiment falls inside confidence interval, we can say 
        null hypothesis is accepted
        point estimate +- margin of error 
    Null Hypothesis (H0):
        Condition to accept experiment
    Alternate Hypothesis (H1):
        Condition reject experiment
    Decision Rule:
        For a one-tailed test, alpha value remains same to reject or accept 
        but for two-tailed test, alpha = alpha/2 on either side of the curve 
        if alpha = 0.05, determine whether problem statement is one-tailed or two-tailed 
        CI = 1-0.05 = 0.95 or 95%. if z-score of a value is within the CI, accept H0 else reject 
        refer z-table to determine tail points. right z-table and 1 - right = left 
        if z-score of a value > right tail point or < left tail point, it means 
        the value is not within the CI 
        which means reject H0 
        z = (sample/statistic mean - population/parametric mean) * sqrt(sample number) /std deviation
    Z-test:
        if z-score lies below or beyond tail points, reject null hypothesis
    p-value:
        smaller the p-value, reject the H0 
        area under the curve beyond the tail points or the z-score 
        if p-value <= significance value, reject the H0 
    Experiment:
        Perform the experiment 
    Reject or Accept:
        if p-value is more than significance value and lies in confidence interval
        accept null hypothesis or accept alternate hypothesis 
            Reject Null Hypothesis, when actual is false - Yes (True -ve)
            Reject Null Hypothesis, when actual is true - Type 1 error
            Accept Null Hypothesis, when actual is false - Type 2 error
            Accept Null Hypothesis, when actual is true - Yes (True +ve)
statistic correlation:
    value between -1 and 1, where 1 means directly proportional and -1 means inversely proportional
    but correlation is NOT causation, correlation between two vectors can be used as a value to understand the changing values between them
        if one value changed in a particular direction
confidence score:
    
Central Limit Theorem
Median Absolute Deviation
Bayes' Theorem 
histogram:
    continuous values 
bar plot :
    discrete values 
box plot: 
    median is the segregation point. helps in determining outliers. 
    Five number summary: minimum, q1, median, q3, maximum
scatter plot
heat map 
eigen value 
eigen vector

use statistics to find relationship between data points: 
    find outliers using the quartile method, z-score 
    determine imputation techniques
    check if the data is normally distributed or not
    same dataset from two or more sources would mean overlapping which means bi-modal or multi-modal 
    target should be to convert non-normal data to normalized or standardized data 
    so that we remove outliers and generic biases from the dataset 
    stratification of clssification data during train, test split 
    variance and standard deviation will help us find the central limit tendency
    CLT of sample and population should be same
    probability density function helps us segment classes from a histogram, boxplot and scatter plots 
    mean, median and mode help us understand how skewed our dataset is
    correlation helps us understand how two variables are related to each other
